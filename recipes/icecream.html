    <h2>What is Ice Cream?</h2>
    <p>
      Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has
      been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a
      spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or
      peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers.
